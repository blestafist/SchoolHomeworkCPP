## ✨ About  

Welcome to my **School Projects & Homework Repository!**  
This repo contains my **C++** and **LibreOffice Calc** projects — everything from small classroom tasks to more complete programming exercises.  

I use this space to track my learning progress, store homework, and experiment with code and formulas.  
You’ll find a mix of educational, practical, and just-for-fun projects.
